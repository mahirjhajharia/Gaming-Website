            <p class="rulenum">RULE 1 - </p>
            <p class="rulename">Think of an issue that needs to be settled</p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Unless you’re playing for amusement, some issue will normally be hanging in the balance. Maybe you’re trying to decide who gets the last slice of pizza or who should be first in line to try out a new waterslide. In most cases, Man, Water, Fire is played as a means to help make a choice or put an end to a disagreement. The idea is that both players have an equal chance of winning, making the game random but fair.

            <p class="rulenum">RULE 2 - </p>
            <p class="rulename">Face off against another person</p>

            <br>
            For the game to play out correctly, there need to be two players. Stand facing one another a few paces apart. Place one hand flat out in front of you, palm up. Your other hand will be used to make the shape of the object you want to play once the game starts.
            <br>
            Man, Water, Fire normally can only be played by two people at a time, but can be played with up to three people.

            <p class="rulenum">RULE 3 - </p>
            <p class="rulename">Count down to make your play</p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Agree on a cue that you’ll use to match shapes with your opponent. In the majority of games, the players throw their shape on the count of three (sometimes counted off by reciting each word of the game’s title). You can also count down by saying "Man, Water, Fire, shoot!" On the word "shoot," both players reveal the object they chose.
            <br>
            Tap your closed playing hand against your palm as you count down. This will help you and your opponent get synchronized.
            <br>
            Be sure that you’re on the same page as far as timing your plays.

        <div class="rule">
            <p class="rulenum">RULE 4 - </p>
            <p class="rulename">Play one of the three objects against your opponent</p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            When it’s time to play, you and your opponent will each form one of the three objects—either Man, Water or Fire. You’ll then name a winner based on which object they played. Every game will be different, so stay alert!
            <br>
            Both players must throw at the same time. If one player delays, the result isn’t trustworthy, and you should start the game over.
            <br>
            Don’t play the same object every time. Switch it up to fool your opponent.

            <p class="rulenum">RULE 5 - </p>
            <p class="rulename">Determine the winner</p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            After you’ve both played an object, look to see who’s won. Each object wins against one shape and loses to another. For instance, water "removes" fire but is "drunk" by men, man "drinks" water but is "burnt" by fire, and fire is "removed" by water but "burns" men. The player who picks the stronger of the two objects is the winner.
            <br>
            If both players throw the same object, it’s a tie. In this situation, simply play again until there is a clear winner.
            <br>
            The loser of the game has the right to call for "best 2 out of 3," meaning that 3 rounds will be played instead of just 1. This gives the losing player a chance to come out on top.

            Here since we are playing with computer so it will act as your opponent.
