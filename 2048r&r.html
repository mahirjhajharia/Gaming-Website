        <div class="para">
            2048 is a game where you combine numbered tiles in order to gain a higher numbered tile. In this game you start with two tiles, the lowest possible number available is two. Then you will play by combining the tiles with the same number to have a tile with the sum of the number on the two tiles. A lot of strategies have been devised in order to obtain the 2048 and be a winner in this game. But others have strived for a greater height. Which is a score beyond 2048. After, achieving the tile with a 2048 tile, players will be asked if you still want to continue the game. Some stop there, but others are determined to continue.

            The game of 2048 does not include complicated controls. The controls you’ll be using are just upward, downward, and sideways. The rules are also simple. You just need to move the tiles and every time you move one, another tile pops up in a random manner anywhere in the box. When two tiles with the same number on them collide with one another as you move them, they will merge into one tile with the sum of the numbers written on them initially.

            <p class="rulenum">RULE 1</p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Start by pushing the tiles to one corner of the square. Placing tiles together in one corner gives you a higher chance to move tiles with the same number closer together. You can use one of the four corners of the box, top left, top right, bottom left, and bottom right. The square at the edge of the corner you chose should contain the highest number so it won’t get in your way while you combine other tiles.

            <p class="rulenum">RULE 2</p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Never place tiles with high numbers in the center of the box. Doing so will make it harder for you to combine other tiles because your tile with a higher number on it will block other tiles with lower numbers that are appearing.

        <div class="rule">
            <p class="rulenum">RULE 3</p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Start with the tiles with small numbers on them. Let the tiles with high numbers on them stay in one corner while you are combining the tiles with smaller numbers. Then the score will increase as time passes by.

        <div class="rule">
            <p class="rulenum">RULE 4</p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Use the boxes that are seen beside the corner you are using to keep the tile with the highest number in order to make it easier to combine them together.

        <div class="para">
            Don’t rush in combining tiles with high values. This might scatter the tiles you are keeping aside and make it harder to combine a lot of tiles. Keep combining squares with small values until you reach your goal.
